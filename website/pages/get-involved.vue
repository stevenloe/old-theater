            For decades, The Old Theater has been bringing the best in movies,
            music, and community theater to Pamlico county. Driven by the
            passion and energy of its volunteers, the Old Theater brings
            together community residents to present quality entertainment and
            moving arts experiences for all ages.

            The Old Theater provides a stage where our diverse community can
            come together to experience and celebrate the joys of theater. But
            our building would be a dark and lonely place if not for people who
            give the generous gift of their time and energy to bring events to
            life. Our volunteers are united by their passion for the performing
            arts. They appreciate how special it is for a town the size of
            Oriental to have a functioning theater where such a variety of
            entertainment is presented to its community.
