          Children's Theater Workshop has a longstanding commitment to enriching
          the lives of children by providing a structured arts program led by an
          exceptional, and carefully chosen, theater arts Drama Coach.

        <p class="mb-4 leading-7 text-gray-900 lg:leading-9 lg:mb-6">
          Besides being great fun, children's theater has many benefits.
          Activities like improv and drama performance can boost self-esteem and
          confidence. The theater is a place where inner silliness and
          creativity are embraced. When children learn to be more confident in
          themselves, it translates to other aspects of their lives &mdash;
          school, communication, and social situations.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-7 text-gray-900 lg:leading-9 lg:mb-6">
          In addition to boosting confidence and creativity, Children's Theater
          Workshop has many other benefits. If your child is in the workshop,
          chances are they’ll have to learn part of a script. When they see what
          they read come to life on the stage, they’ll likely improve their
          reading comprehension elsewhere. It might even make them more
          interested in reading off the stage, too! More at
