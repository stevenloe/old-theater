          Children's Theater Workshop has a longstanding commitment to enriching
          the lives of children by providing a structured arts program led by an
          exceptional, and carefully chosen, theater arts Drama Coach.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 leading-7 text-gray-900 lg:leading-9 lg:mb-6">
          Besides being great fun, children's theater has many benefits.
          Activities like improv and drama performance can boost self-esteem and
          confidence. The theater is a place where inner silliness and
          creativity are embraced. When children learn to be more confident in
          themselves, it translates to other aspects of their lives &mdash;
          school, communication, and social situations.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-7 text-gray-900 lg:leading-9 lg:mb-6">
          During the age-divided, two-week sessions, children are introduced to theater skills such as acting fundamentals, learning to speak on stage, using drama exercises by playing theater games, see the behind-the-scenes work, learn to work in peer groups, and meet new friends.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-7 text-gray-900 lg:leading-9 lg:mb-6">
Learning about the performing arts can teach important skills in life, such as self-confidence, cooperation, self-discipline, and concentration. Imagination is encouraged! More at
