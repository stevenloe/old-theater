The Old Theater is proud to present our Actor’s Workshop. The workshops will be informal, creative and fun.

Each workshop will focus on developing different aspects of the actor’s trade, both individually and in groups on stage.

* **WHAT:**  Monologues, Character Preparation, Scene and script study and coaching. 


**There is no cost for the workshop.**  However, donations and memberships are encouraged and are tax deductible.  Our goal is to help develop the arts in Pamlico County and to grow The Old Theater.
