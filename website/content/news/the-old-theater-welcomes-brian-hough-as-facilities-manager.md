With over 40 years of experience in creative fields, Brian has been part of, or started, numerous organizations and businesses related to sculpture, ceramics, carpentry, and ship construction. His hands-on experience with all these fields will be a great asset to The Old Theater, along with his creative, out of the box thinking.  

After retiring, Brian and his wife Kay decided to leave their home in California and travel.  They recently arrived in Oriental on their Trimaran *Jammin* which he built himself over 30 years ago. They both are enjoying the community of Oriental and are looking forward to the years ahead.
