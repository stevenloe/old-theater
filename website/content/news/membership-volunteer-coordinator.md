I am Andrea Bayard and I am the Membership and Volunteer Coordinator for the Old Theater.  

My husband Rob and I have lived in Oriental for the last 3 years.  My husband still works and travels but I am staying put.  We have moved over 45 times in 30 different locations with his work.  I usually found a job in an International School working with special needs children when we were overseas. Earlier in my career I worked for 10 years in the electronics field in the Boulder Colorado area.  Otherwise I just pick up something new to try in one of our locations.

We still love to travel and take as many vacations as time allows.  Rob is English so we travel once a year to England to see his parents and friends.  

I have 2 children 4 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.  They all live in the Raleigh area so I get to see them.  Nice to be close.   We also have a dog Molly who is almost 2.  She is an English field bred Cocker Spaniel.   Our cat Archie found us by showing up on our doorstep.  They are both so special.

My love of the theatre started when we lived in London.  I had several girlfriends who gathered for a monthly trip to the theatre and lunch.  It was great fun.

That is us in a nutshell.  Hope to meet lots of you all soon.
