Friday Flicks began 20 years ago at The Old Theater with an idea, a donated projector, and free popcorn.  Over the years it was the place to gather on the third Friday of the month to have a beverage, enjoy candy and free popcorn, Flash Gordon or cartoons and a movie.  Friday Flicks filled a void in the local entertainment opportunities.

The Old Theater has tried to keep up by showing newly released movies, a variety of family and holiday movies to attract more of an audience.  While there is still a loyal audience, the overall numbers have dropped even before Covid-19.

With the popularity of online streaming and the increased number of Oriental venues providing Friday night entertainment, Friday Flicks can no longer compete.  Therefore, the Board of Directors has made the tough decision to discontinue Friday Flicks, effective immediately.  There is no matinee on Sunday, January 9th.

The Old Theater will launch Sunday Classic Cinema on a trial basis through the end of our season in May.  At 3:00 p.m. on Sunday afternoons, Flash Gordon and classic movies from the public domain will be shown for a $6.00 ticket.  Free popcorn, plus soft drinks and bottled water by donation will be available.  No outside food or drink please by order of the state.  Sunday Classic Cinema will continue, if there is enough attendance to justify it.  We will continue to comply with State and local Covid-19 guidance.  Just a reminder that the Old Theater installed professional grade air purifiers in September, which are fully operational at all times.
