Oriental’s Old Theater first opened its doors as a movie theater in 1946, and served  as a social entertainment center until the late 50s. It was revitalized and reopened in 1995, providing a venue where performing arts can thrive in Pamlico County.

The Old Theater is owned and managed by the Old Theater Corporation, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. All memberships and donations are tax deductible. Its Board is comprised of Pamlico County volunteers whose mission is to ensure that Pamlico County and the town of Oriental has a venue for civic and cultural events. The ability to achieve this mission depends on the ongoing support and participation of individuals, businesses, service organizations, grants and volunteers on stage and behind the scenes.

Thanks to the generosity of people like **YOU**, significant improvements have been accomplished over the past few years. A successful 2022 membership drive will enable us to continue needed improvements and the variety of entertainment our community has come to enjoy. 

We need and welcome your financial support and look forward to hearing from you. If you are a current member of the Old Theater, we thank you again for your generous support and hope we can count on it for 2022. If you are a new member for 2022, thank you and welcome!  We look forward to seeing everyone throughout the coming year.
