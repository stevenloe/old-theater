The Board of Directors of the Old Theater Corp. are happy to announce we have selected new officers, Carla Fisher as President and Teresa Conrads as Vice President. With the resignation of Izzy Keppner, who did an outstanding job as President for the past three years, our search for her replacement resulted in enthusiasm and excitement as we learned that these two accomplished women were interested in serving on the Board. Here is an introduction to these outstanding community volunteers:

Carla Fisher has a love for the arts, a keen business acumen, and a holistic approach and vision necessary for effective leadership of The Old Theater. She is the successful business owner/founder of ArtWorks Oriental, the studio for working artists in our local community. She is an award-winning artist (Fiber Art, Big Metal Sculpture, and Glassblowing) who worked as resident artist at the Cherry Street Pier in Philadelphia, PA. One such award was the prestigious international DaVinci Award presented to her in Florence, Italy for her innovation, professionalism, and contributions to the art community. Carla is involved in local community affairs and serves on the Tourism Board in Oriental and the Board of Directors for the Pamlico County Arts Council. Her background in business began at Columbia University and University of Missouri where she earned a degree in finance with minors in accounting and business law. Her 25-year career with Merrill Lynch started in Germany where she worked as a stockbroker, branch manager, and district sales manager. Carla brings to the theater a distinctive set of skills that combine her love of the arts with successful business management, both valuable assets to The Old Theater. She has experience in theater as well serving on the Board of Directors of the Community Theater in Williamsport, PA. Her vision for the Old Theater includes adding more live performances and exploring strategic alliances with schools, organizations, and businesses as well as other theater groups, to publicly promote The Old Theater’s reach and awareness throughout the region.

Teresa Conrads is a musician, songwriter, and performer with a love for performing arts and a desire to volunteer her time and talent to the Old Theater. Teresa grew up in Eastern, NC the daughter of a US Marine stationed at Havelock. She came by her love of the theater through her mother, a graduate of NY High School of Performing Arts. Thanks to her mother's active participation in productions in Havelock and New Bern, she began her journey into community theater at 6 years old. Teresa was an active member of New Bern Civic Theater and New Bern's Footlight Theater through much of the early 80's, both behind the scenes as well as on stage. Teresa enjoyed a distinguished military sprint in the US Navy for five years. The discipline she acquired in the military helped her become the talented musician she is today. After serving in the Navy in San Diego, Teresa moved up to Los Angeles with her former husband and pursued a music career. She has been performing at festivals and small venues under the pseudonym TerryLynn Melody for over 10 years now. In 2016, Teresa’s Facebook fans voted her into first place in an online contest netting her $10,000 to complete her album. This Americana, singer-songwriter recorded her debut album “Counting Daydreams” which she wrote, arranged, and produced shortly before returning to NC. Teresa loves Pamlico County and is a member of the Pamlico Chorale as well as the Pamlico Band. Teresa’s participation in the Old Theater’s Got Talent virtual talent show in 2020 opened the door to new possibilities with local theater. She highly values the arts and finds artistic expression the perfect way to explore and better understand life.

Two additional volunteers have recently joined the Board, Patrick Nocera as Creative Director and Olga Herman as House/Box Office Manager. The Board is currently accepting applicants for soon-to-be open positions of Theater-Sponsored Events Manager, Treasurer, and Grant Writing. The Old Theater thanks its current members for their ongoing support and welcomes new members. Volunteers are the life blood of the theater and new opportunities to perform on stage or work behind the scenes will be announced soon.
