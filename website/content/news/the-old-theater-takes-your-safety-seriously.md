The Old Theater continues to follow the state and local guidance regarding the Covid-19 virus.  

Shows are subject to change and cancellation, based on Covid-19 guidance. The safety and health of our community are paramount and we thank you for your understanding. 

Through collaboration with Pamlico Musical Society and grant funding we have installed commercial air purifiers in The Old Theater for the comfort and safety of our patrons.  Please direct any questions about other events to the organization hosting that event.
