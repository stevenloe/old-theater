American Graffiti may be the best film about teenagers ever made, an influential coming-of-age film and nominee for an Academy Award for Best Picture. It is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of high school grads’ last days of innocence. Set in Modesto, California, at the end of summer in 1962, the film is a study of the cruising and early rock ‘n’ roll cultures. Through a series of vignettes, the film tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a night before heading east for college the next morning. This music-filled movie still holds up nearly a half century later for its impressionistic soundtrack which includes no fewer than 41 pop singles, virtually all of them performed by a band at a school dance or blasted out of car radios. American Graffiti is pretty much terrific all around.

Stars: Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, MacKenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins, and Wolfman Jack.

All proceeds from ticket donations and the 50/50 raffle will go to benefit the Old Theater, a registered 501©(3) non-profit organization, located at 609 Broad Street in Oriental, NC.
