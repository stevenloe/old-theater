A child prodigy and internationally renowned concert violinist for over 30 years, Midori transfixes audiences by bringing together graceful precision and intimate expression. 

Typically soloing with the likes of symphony orchestras of London, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Berlin, Vienna, New York, Los Angeles and St. Petersburg, do not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience Midori live and in concert in Oriental! Midori’s appearance is made possible in part by the non-profit organization Partners in Performance. Founded by Midori, Partners in Performance aims to keep chamber music alive and accessible in the heartland of America.
