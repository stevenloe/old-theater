Father Christmas has been kidnapped! And it's only a week until Christmas! This disaster must be adverted, or Christmas morning will be ruined!  With little time to spare, Mother Christmas calls for the Council of Fictional Christmas Characters to solve the crime in this comical Yuletide mystery spoof.

Mother Christmas, Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jack Frost, the heroes of O. Henry’s “Gift of the Magi” and the strange little girl named Want, from Christmas Carol, join forces to bring their Victorian-style Santa home again.  Comedy ensues, complete with audience participation. Characters will wander the audience, answering questions about the crime, and each member of the audience gets to take a crack at solving just what happened to Father Christmas.

This bright Bill Hand comedy, acted by the North Carolina History Theater players, has lively dialogue, plot twists and comic confrontations, in a show that is suitable for everyone!
