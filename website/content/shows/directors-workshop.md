The Old Theater is proud to present our Directors Workshop
designed to draw new directors into the theater thus supporting the
overall goal of developing the arts in Pamlico County and growing
The Old Theater. 

- WHEN: Wednesday evenings at 6:30pm; March 1 to June 1, 2023. 
- WHERE: The Old Theater, 609 Broad Street, Oriental, NC
The Old Theater is proud to present our Directors Workshop designed to draw new directors into the theater thus supporting the overall goal of developing the arts in Pamlico County and growing The Old Theater.
- WHAT: Each workshop will focus on the role of director who has
the challenging task of bringing it all together: the script, actors,
set, costuming, lighting, and sound. Skills to develop are
interpreting the script, casting the production, collaborating with
designers, planning rehearsals, and guiding actors in their work.

In August, new directors will direct a one-act play for an audience who
will vote to determine the winners of the Director Awards.
There is no cost for the workshop. However, donations and
memberships are encouraged and are tax deductible.
