The Old Theater is pleased to present Henri Herbert. With 100 million YouTube views, Henri Herbert is a piano playing phenomenon and one of the most sought after blues and boogie players in the world. 

The former stevedore and boxer performs a visceral, timeless show of original songs and covers featuring piano and vocals inspired by the great American blues pianists of the 20th century, not only keeping this unique form of American music alive and well, but also advancing it forward.
