The Old Theater in collaboration with The Silos in Oriental present our May Friday Flick:  **A League of Their Own.** Admission by donation. Includes FREE popcorn.

The Silos is cooking Stadium favorites for purchase. Regular menu available for take-out via ChowNow app. Cash bar available with beer, wine, soft drinks, and concessions. No outside food or beverages please, by order of the state.

We continue to follow CDC and state guidelines regarding COVID-19.

As America’s stock of athletic young men is depleted during World War II, a professional all-female baseball league springs up in the Midwest, funded by publicity-hungry candy maker Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall). Competitive sisters Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty) spar with each other, scout Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) and grumpy has-been coach Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) on their way to fame. Madonna and Rosie O’Donnell co-star as two of the sisters’ teammates.

All proceeds from ticket donations and the 50/50 raffle will go to benefit the Old Theater, a registered 501©(3) non-profit organization, located at 609 Broad Street in Oriental, NC.
