The Old Theater in Oriental is pleased to announce its production of Dilemmas with Dinner, a farce written in two acts.  The play is written by Robin Roberts and directed by Oriental’s community theater director, Pat Nocera.  
Dilemmas with Dinner is suitable for all audiences. Tickets can be purchased at Nautical Wheelers, on-line at www.oldtheater.org or at the box office window on performance dates. 

Laugh with us as you see what happens when junior executive, Brooke, invites her boss and his wife over for dinner in the hopes of securing a promotion.  As Brooke is frantically getting the final touches on the table, her husband comes home bent over with severe back issues from an accident.  They then discover that the caterer hired to impress the boss is, unfortunately, the boss’s ex-daughter-in-law.  It seems that everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.  Until, that is, Brooke’s boss makes a disastrous announcement triggering a candlestick attack, an appetizer toss and general madness and pandemonium.

Join veteran The Old Town Theater actors Elaine Creel, Cherry D’Angelo, Ben Gaskill, and Tim Wall as well as newcomers Sheila Gould, Jessica Russo, James Sherwood and Christine Wager as they lead you through a night of mayhem and confusion.
