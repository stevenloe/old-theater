The Old Theater Presents the North Carolina History Theater in "Murder in the Manor" A Comic Murder Mystery by Bill Hand
 
Murder in the Manor is the first comic murder mystery written by Bill Hand, Director of the North Carolina History Theater of New Bern. The plot begins with the murder of a small-town publishing magnate, Artemus Ward, while waiting for a meeting with someone at the Manor, a badly-run restaurant set in an old home. Who did it? The possible culprits wind up being everyone on stage.

Bill Hand returns to The Old Theater with a play that has plot twists and fun interaction with actors coming into the audience during intermission to answer questions from the audience. After the fourth act, the audience turns in their “whodunnit” forms and a prize is awarded to the person with the best guess at the end of the play. 

General Admission Tickets:  $18.00 or $15.00 for Old Theater Corp. members, military & students with a proper ID.
