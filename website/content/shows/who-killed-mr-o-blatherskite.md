### How about a little Western mayhem in your life? 

The Old Theater and the North Carolina History Theater come together for another fun comic murder mystery, “Who Killed Mr. O’Blatherskite?”

Mr. O’Blatherskite, the corrupt president of a western railroad, has been found murdered in his private car. All the suspects are on the train:  Sheriff Randy, a fatherly type of guy and his sidekick Arney, the Barney-Fife-like Deputy; Mac, a gambler and con artist and his sidekick the not-so-sweet Sweet Mary. Throw in Duncan, the conductor, who used to own this railroad until Mr. O’Blatherskite won it from him with a questionable five-ace straight and the determined lady bounty hunter, Jane Dade, who is tracking Mac and swears she will always get her man.  

Every soul has a motive to kill the deceased, and plenty of broad and silly comedy ensues as they work to solve the crime! The audience gets to try and solve it as well, interviewing the suspects between scenes, and the best guessing guest at the end of the night wins a prize!   

For extra fun, come dressed (optional!) in your Western best!
