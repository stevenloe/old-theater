HISTORY TO HIP HOP - Jonathan Blanchard, a highly respected and multi-talented artist, musician, historian, and storyteller brings an electrifying, interactive concert to the Old Theater. Along with his band, Blanchard chronicles the evolution of African American music from inspirational field songs to gospel, jazz, R&B, blues, funk, and hip hop. Soul singer, actor, songwriter, and performer rooted since childhood in the Memphis music scene, Blanchard is heavily influenced by artists such as Earth Wind and Fire, The Bark-Kays, and W.C. Handy. Blanchard's soulful delivery of music has a seductive sound reminiscent of artists such as Barry White, Isaac Hayes, and Nat King Cole. Jonathan Blanchard's concerts are leaving an indelible impact on audiences across the southeast. This one is a jewel in The Old Theater's crown.

Jonathan will present a special outreach performance for the Pamlico County community on Friday, May 20th, at 6:00 PM at the Holt's Chapel Community Center in Oriental. Admission for this show is free and everyone is encouraged to attend.

These performances are funded in part by a grant from South Arts in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts and The Old Theater Corp. All proceeds go to support The Old Theater Corp., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
