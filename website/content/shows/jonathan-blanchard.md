Jonathan Blanchard brings an electrifying concert and storytelling experience to The Old Theater Saturday night, May 21st. Along with his band, Blanchard chronicles the evolution of African American music from inspirational field songs to gospel, jazz, R&B, blues, funk, and hip hop. This soul singer, actor, songwriter, and performer is heavily influenced by artists who preceded him such as Earth Wind and Fire, The Bar-Kays, and W.C. Handy. Blanchard’s soulful delivery of music has a seductive sound reminiscent of artists such as Barry White, Isaac Hayes, and Nat King Cole. Jonathan Blanchard’s concerts are leaving an indelible impact on audiences across the southeast. This one is a jewel in The Old Theater’s crown.
