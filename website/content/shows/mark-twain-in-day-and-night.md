### Meet Mark Twain!

The great American man of humor and sardonic wit is returning to Oriental’s Old Theater this October 14 and 15, 2022 at 7:30 with **_Day and Night_**, a one man show featuring Bill Hand as the immortal Samuel Clemens, also known as Mark Twain.  Tickets can be purchased at Nautical Wheelers or on-line.  Cost of admission is $20.00 for the general public or $15.00 for members, military and children.

If you only know Mark Twain through Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn, those mischievous imaginative boys, who delighted us in “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer”, you are in for some wonderful surprises.  Twain’s writings moved easily from pure fun to gentle satire to scathing rage to commentary on humanity.  Bill Hand’s arrangement of Twain’s works will give you a sampling of all of these styles.  

‘Day’, the first act, focuses on Twain’s earlier and best-known works.  

Hand said, “We’ll include a little biography and some of his more popular tales from excerpts of Tom Sawyer to his most famous short stories such as The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County or the Wounded Buffalo from his book _Roughing It_”.

“Night”, the second act, will visit more of his critical writings and observations, which were full of wit, irony and sometimes barely controlled rage.  Hand stated, “It’s an act with some very powerful moments”.  Among these moments will be The War Prayer, On Being the Chief Love and Delight of God, and the true story about a slave woman who lived in New Bern during the Civil War after her children had been sold away from her. 

Hand has performed as Mark Twain for many years and said he feels a close kinship to the author’s sensibilities and life. Hand remarked that “Twain was a fierce friend and a dangerous foe.  His mind was always racing and for all his cynicism he loved life, despite the tragedy of his later years.  And no one was a greater lover of family than Twain.”

Bill Hand is the president of the North Carolina History Theater and is familiar to Oriental audiences through his writing and performances.  Recently, The North Carolina History Theater’s “Who Killed Mr. O’Blatherskite” was seen at the Old Theater and the company will bring another comic mystery, “The Miscreants’ Christmas” in December.  In the past he also directed “Exit the King” for the theater company.
