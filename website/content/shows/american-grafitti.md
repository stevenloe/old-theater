Curt and Steve have gotten into a prestigious college, but Curt is having second thoughts on the night before they're going to leave for the school. That night, Curt searches relentlessly for a spellbinding woman in a white T-Bird while Steve tries to patch things up with his girlfriend after suggesting they date other people while he's away. Their two other friends John and Terry also have a wild night, John when he's forced to chauffer a little girl and Terry when he borrows Steve's car and picks up a girl but then has trouble living up to the expectations set by the car.
