We continue to follow CDC and state guidelines regarding COVID-19.

As America’s stock of athletic young men is depleted during World War II, a professional all-female baseball league springs up in the Midwest, funded by publicity-hungry candy maker Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall). Competitive sisters Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty) spar with each other, scout Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) and grumpy has-been coach Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) on their way to fame. Madonna and Rosie O’Donnell co-star as two of the sisters’ teammates.

All proceeds from ticket donations and the 50/50 raffle will go to benefit the Old Theater, a registered 501©(3) non-profit organization, located at 609 Broad Street in Oriental, NC.
