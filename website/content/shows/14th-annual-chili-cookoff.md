The 14th Annual Chili Cookofff is just around the corner. We need YOU to select the next Dragon Chili Champ! Who will win the title as the Judge’s Choice?  Who will win the title as the People’s Choice?  Come to this year’s tasting and find out.  

This year's cookoff takes place on Saturday, October 22nd, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Oriental Marina & Inn Courtyard.  Judge’s Choice, People’s Choice, and Spirit Award (best decorated table) will be presented immediately after the tasting ends. 

Enjoy some **great** chili while supporting The Old Theater!  Funds raised by this annual event go to support The Old Theater—the building, its contents and equipment.  Throughout the year, The Old Theater provides a venue for live performances, concerts, children’s programs and workshops, films and a variety of civic, business, and charity events.  All these activities require stage, lights, sounds and the support of many people who volunteer on stage and behind the scenes - people like YOU - who appreciate how special it is for a town the size of Oriental to have a theater that brings such a variety of entertainment to its community. 

Dieters, beware!  There will be a Bake Sale Table at this year’s event with tasty goods baked by local talent, each item(s) individually wrapped and selling for $1.00. To Go Orders can be purchased at the Headquarters Table, $5.00 for 16-ounces of left-over chili from the Chef of your choice.

The Old Theater is going GREEN again this year in support of our environment and our children’s future.  Tasters’ cups and utensils, plus Chefs’ gloves and trash bags are all disposable and biodegradable. We need your help to make the 14th Annual Chili Cookoff a fun and successful community event in support of The Old Theater.  For more information or if you would like to participate as Baker, Volunteer, or Sponsor, please contact The Old Theater:

Hope to see you there!
