shortDesc: "\"James Bond (Sir Sean Connery) is back and his next mission takes
  him to Fort Knox, where Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fr√∂be) and his henchman are
  planning to raid Fort Knox and obliterate the world economy. To save the world
  once again, Bond will need to become friends with Goldfinger, dodge killer
  hats, and avoid Goldfinger's personal pilot, the sexy Pussy Galore (Honor
  Blackman). She might not have feelings for Bond, but will 007 help her change
  her mind?\""
