The Old Theater in Oriental is happy to announce an audition
for its new production, a dramatic comedy written by Samuel
D. Hunter and directed by Patrick Nocera.

The Cast:
- Carol - early to mid-sixties
- Bo - Carol’s son, mid to late-thirties
- Ally - Carol’s daughter, early to mid-thirties
- Martin (on video only) - Carol’s husband, Bo and Ally’s father, early to mid-sixties
 

A liquored-up-dysfunctional-family-reunion follows the death of
Bo and Ally’s father escalating with intense face-offs and
arresting revelations that explore the distance families put
between themselves and what it takes to bring them back
together.
