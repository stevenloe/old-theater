Shiver me timbers! The Old Theater has recruited a motley crew of local talent to perform a double swashbuckler - _Blackbeard’s Last Revenge_, written by P.F. Nocera, and _13 Signs You Should Stop Being a Pirate_, by A.M. Dittman. Director Nocera portrays a historically accurate snapshot of Blackbeard’s final day and last revenge while the crew faces lifestyle questions about sword fighting, treasure, and manatees that look like mermaids. It’s an entertaining comedy of life at sea and an insight into the complex mind of Edward Teach. How much does it cost a pirate to get his ears pierced? Arrr -  ‘bout a buccaneerrrrrr! Suitable for all ages. 

Box Office opens one hour before the show. Doors open 30 minutes before show begins.Location: 609 Broad Street, Oriental, NC 28571
