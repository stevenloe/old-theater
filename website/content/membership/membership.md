The Old Theater is a vibrant and meaningful part of Oriental’s history and future as a cultural center in our community.  It takes many volunteers to bring those words in a script to life — volunteers who are very active long before the first actor takes the stage.

If you have skills with accounting, project management, grant writing, or websites, or a keen willingness to learn, we especially need your help as we begin our new season.  Specifically, we have openings on our Board of Directors for the positions of: 

Treasurer    
Events Coordinator  
Membership and Volunteer Coordinator  
Grant Writing  
Website Manager  

If any of these sound intriguing to you, we ask you to please let us know by contacting any Board member, writing us at <a href="mailto:oldtheater@gmail.com">oldtheater@gmail.com</a>,  or by contacting me personally at 206-406-1621 for more information. 

Not ready for a full time Board position commitment?  That’s okay!  We still need you!  Many of our departments, including Tech Services (lighting and sound), Front of the House (greeters and ticket takers), graphic art design, publicity distribution, Chili Cookoff volunteers, and sponsorship solicitations also need your help on an occasional or rotating basis.  Brother (or sister!) can you spare some time?

Oh, and did I mention that we also need those actors and actresses, musicians, set designers, directors, and wardrobe folks?  They are the characters that make us laugh and make us cry, and remind us of just why we need this cultural hub.  You can be one!  We can teach you through one of our many new workshops we will be conducting.

Still not ready to take that step?  You can still be a part of the magic at the Old Theater!  After all these other volunteers do their part, we will ask you to do your part by being those “cheeks in the seats” that make it all worthwhile for those who have worked so hard to bring these performances to you!  Attend a performance… or two… or ten!  Consider a membership in the Old Theater to ensure our ability to continue to bring great programming to you for years to come.

Maybe you are beginning to see that there is a role for everyone at The Old Theater!  How might YOU become involved?


Sincerely,  


Carla Fisher  
President, The Old Theater Corporation
