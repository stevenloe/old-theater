What does it mean to be a member of the Old Theater?  It means a LOT!

It means you are playing a supporting role in ensuring the Old Theater remains a vibrant part of our culture in Pamlico County.

It means our lives are enriched by the stories that are told, both by the writer of the play and the actor who is a part of community theater, simply because there is one.

It means we can hear the laughter — those “extra” dollars you gave to enhance your level of membership may just have paid for a microphone or two.

It means we can burst with pride as we watch our young people bask in the spotlight, because the lights can go on — your membership helps pay the utility bills.

It means every actor and stage hand feels special:  you are also the audience that comes to see them deliver their lines, sing their tune, or marvel at the set construction they created.

Your membership dollars help create and maintain a home for other organizations such as the Pamlico Music Society or the Children’s Theater as well as our Old Theater performances.

Our members are our lifeblood at the Old Theater!  If you are already a member, we thank you so sincerely for your past support!  We ask you to stand proud with the Old Theater again by renewing your membership today.  Perhaps you can strike a higher note by elevating your membership level this year.

Never been a member?  Today is the perfect day to become one!
