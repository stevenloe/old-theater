Our success - past, present, and future - is dependent on the dedication of our volunteers whose time, talents and spirit continue to bring the quality entertainment that The Old Theater prides itself on. Many faces truly bring our theater to life - booking touring acts, selling tickets, planning fundraisers, planning shows & rehearsals, running sound & lights, serving popcorn, sweeping floors and shining on stage. We welcome volunteers from throughout the Community.
