Members & Volunteers are the heartbeat of The Old Theater. Whether they volunteer on the Board of Directors, use their talents to sing and act in stage productions, or assist with fundraisers, they complete the community that is The Old Theater. Pamlico County and Oriental are lucky to have so many fun loving and talented people! Thank you all!
