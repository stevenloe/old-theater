The Old Theater reopened with community support in the mid 1990's and has been fortunate to maintain that support today. In addition to those who financially support our productions and fundraising, there are a host of local businesses and individuals who collaborate behind the scenes with us to provide venue space, extended advertisement, storage and additional financial support through special donations. We salute our community partners who work behind the scenes to help keep The Old Theater front and center for performing arts in Pamlico County.
