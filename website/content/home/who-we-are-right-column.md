whose mission is to ensure the people of Pamlico County and the town of Oriental have a local venue for civic and cultural events. 

This mission is accomplished by maintaining the facility and grounds; making the facility available for use by providers of performing arts and a variety of civic, business, local clubs, schools and charitable organizations; and by presenting a broad range of theater-sponsored programs and outreach to the schools throughout Pamlico County.

The ability to achieve this mission relies on the support and participation of our members, individual donors, community businesses, service organizations, grants and volunteers on stage and behind the scenes.  If you would like to volunteer with the Old Theater, or participate in a future event, go to our volunteer page.
