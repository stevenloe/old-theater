The Old Theater is located at 609 Broad Street in the heart of Oriental, North Carolina. The building first opened as a movie theater in 1945 and served as a social and entertainment center until the late 1950s.  It was revitalized and reopened in 1995 and today provides a venue where performing arts can thrive in Pamlico County.

The Old Theater is owned and managed by the Old Theater Corporation, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization comprised of Pamlico County volunteers, whose mission is to ensure the people of Pamlico County and the town of Oriental have a local venue for civic and cultural events. 

This mission is accomplished by maintaining the facility and grounds; making the facility available for use by providers of performing arts and a variety of civic, business, local clubs, 

schools and charitable organizations; and by presenting a broad range of theater-sponsored programs and outreach to the schools throughout Pamlico County.
