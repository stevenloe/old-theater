## Help The Old Theater Thrive

The Old Theater Corporation is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  As such, all cash donations and in-kind donations are tax deductible.

While we bring performing arts and movies to the community, ticket sales provide only a portion of the needed income to cover the upkeep of the Old Theater.  We appreciate and rely on the generous support of our members, individual donors, community businesses, service organizations, grants, and volunteers both on stage and behind the scenes to keep performing arts alive in Pamlico County.
