For decades, The Old Theater has been bringing the best in movies, music, and community theater to Pamlico county. Driven by the passion and energy of its volunteers, the Old Theater brings together community residents to present quality entertainment and moving arts experiences for all ages.

### We Need Volunteers

The Old Theater provides a stage where our diverse community can come together to experience and celebrate the joys of theater. But our building would be a dark and lonely place if not for people who give the generous gift of their time and energy to bring events to life. Our volunteers are united by their passion for the performing arts. They appreciate how special it is for a town the size of Oriental to have a functioning theater where such a variety of entertainment is presented to its community.
