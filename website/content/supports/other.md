### 1.  Shop Local 
Our local businesses are here for you and your families.  Your patronage of their products and services not only helps ensure the future of their business here in the community it ensures the livelihood of those business owners and their families.  In turn those businesses help The Old Theater and other local organizations by sponsoring events, advertising at events, and membership dues.

### 2. Amazon Smile  
There is no way that our wonderful shops here locally can supply every want and need of our community.   If and when you find yourself shopping at Amazon for those items you can still support The Old Theater.
