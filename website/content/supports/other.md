# Other Ways to Support Us

### 1.  Shop Locally!  
Support the wonderful business in our area that are here for you. When you do this, you're helping to keep Oriental and Pamlico county a vibrant, great place to live. You're also supporting local families - many of whom support the Old Theater's programs via sponsorship, membership, co-hosted events and more.

### 2. Amazon Smile  
Sometimes it's not possible to find that certain special item in our local shops. If you find yourself shopping at Amazon for those items, you can still support the Old Theater. When you shop at smile.amazon.com, Amazon will make a small donation to the charity of your choice.
