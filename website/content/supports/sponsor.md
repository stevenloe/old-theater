As a small community theater, we take pride in bringing you great productions and performers from around Pamlico county, across the country, and across the globe.   Our intimate setting is part of what makes The Old Theater such a *great* place to see a performance.  You’re close to the action on stage… much closer than you would be at a larger venue.

Being a small theater also presents some challenges, one of which is that revenue from ticket sales alone often does not cover the costs of staging a production, bringing a musical artist to town, or putting a movie you love on our big screen.  

Because of this, we ask for your help bringing events to our stage.  Your support in sponsoring these acts will help ensure the future of The Old Theater and our ability to continue to provide talented artists and performers for your enjoyment.
