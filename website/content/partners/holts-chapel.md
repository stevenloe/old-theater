Julius Rosenwald, who never finished high school and yet rose to become the President of Sears & Roebuck, was influenced by the writings of the educator and former slave, Booker T. Washington, founder of the Tuskegee Institute.  Inspired by a deep concern over racial inequality in America, Rosenwald joined forces with Washington to help African American communities build 5,000 of these schools between 1912 and 1933 – and a future for black children in the South. 

Once the pride of their communities, many of these schools were later abandoned or demolished.  In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed the Rosenwald Schools on its 11 Most Endangered Historic Places list.   

There were three Rosenwald schools in Pamlico County and Holt’s Chapel Elementary School is the only remaining one in continuous operation, celebrating their Centennial in 2021.  Restoration continues today for this historic site with the goal to be added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Holt’s Chapel Community Center, a living piece of history in Pamlico County, is located on Janeiro Road outside Oriental, NC. 

A remarkable documentary titled “Rosenwald,” about the partnership of African American communities with Jewish Sears executive Julius Rosenwald and educator Booker T. Washington, was released in 2015 and can be viewed online on many platforms.  Holt’s Chapel Community Center, Inc. maintains a copy for presentation to local schools, organizations and clubs.  Presentations may include personal accounts of local residents who were students at the school.  Contact Holt’s Chapel Community Center, Inc. via Facebook for further information.
