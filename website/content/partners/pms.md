The mission of the Pamlico Musical Society is to present diverse musical experiences that enrich the quality of life in our community. Since 1997, our concert performances and outreach activities have provided opportunities to enjoy and interact with a wide variety of high quality musical groups representing many musical genres.

Our primary performance venue is the Old Theater, where the small hall promotes intimate exchanges between the artists and audiences &mdash; further enhancing the significance of the musical experience. Many of our artists also present an outreach component which extends the impact of our programs to partners including the Pamlico County Public Schools, the Arapahoe Charter School, the Pamlico Christian Academy, HeartWorks, Prime Time, the Holt's Chapel Community Center, and the Pamlico Community College.

With a season that runs from September/October through April/May each year, our Grammy-quality programming embraces bluegrass, jazz, classical, folk, rock, Americana, pop, blues and more, offering something special for everyone who loves great music.
