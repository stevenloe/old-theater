Children's Theater Workshop has a longstanding commitment to enriching the lives of children by providing a structured arts program led by an exceptional, and carefully chosen, theater arts Drama Coach.

Besides being great fun, children's theater has many benefits. Activities like improv and drama performance can boost self-esteem and confidence. The theater is a place where inner silliness and creativity are embraced. When children learn to be more confident in themselves, it translates to other aspects of their lives &mdash; school, communication, and social situations.

During the age-divided, two-week sessions, children are introduced to theater skills such as acting fundamentals, learning to speak on stage, using drama exercises by playing theater games, see the behind-the-scenes work, learn to work in peer groups, and meet new friends.

Learning about the performing arts can teach important skills in life, such as self-confidence, cooperation, self-discipline, and concentration. Imagination is encouraged! More at [www.childrenstheateronc.com](https://www.childrenstheateronc.com/)
