You’ll find the Old Theater at 609 Broad Street in the heart of Oriental, North Carolina. The building first opened as a movie theater in 1945 and served as a social and entertainment center until the late 1950s. It was revitalized and reopened in 1995 and today provides a venue where performing arts can thrive in Pamlico County.

The Old Theater is owned and managed by the Old Theater Corporation, a registered 501(c)(3) organization comprised of Pamlico County volunteers whose mission is to ensure that Pamlico County and the town of Oriental has a venue for civic and cultural events. That mission is accomplished in the following ways:


- By making the facility available for use by providers of performing arts and a variety of civic business, club and charity organizations
- By presenting a broad range of theater-sponsored programs.
- By the daily maintanance and operation of the facility and grounds


The ability to achieve this mission depends on the ongoing support and participation of individual contributors, community businesses, service organizations, grants and folks who volunteer on stage and behind the scenes.
