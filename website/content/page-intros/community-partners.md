Oriental is a unique cultural hub in coastal Carolina, replete with residents of many talents and interests.  Working in partnership with as many other organizations as possible, we can showcase those talents and the talents of performing artists brought to our region in a way that is greater than any one organization can do alone. 


We are proud of our outreach focus, be it for a single event like the upcoming one with the Old Front Porch Music Festival, or with a long term relationship like the one we enjoy with Pamlico Music Society.  Below is a peek at just a few of those partnerships we hold dear.  


We are always looking for ways we can bring more cultural arts to Pamlico County that will enrich the lives of our citizens and guests, benefit the businesses that support us, and plant seeds of creativity that will grow into opportunities for joy and learning in the future. If your organization has an idea how the Old Theater can work with you, please let us know! *When we work together, we all win!*
