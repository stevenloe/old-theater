# COVID-19

The Old Theater continues to follow the state and local guidance provided regarding the COVID-19 virus. At this time, we are hosting the Summer Outdoor Cinema with The Silos at The Red Rooster, and are setting up our Fall schedule! The health and safety of our community is paramount and we will update everyone as soon as possible.
