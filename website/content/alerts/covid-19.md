# COVID-19

The Old Theater continues to follow the state and local guidance provided with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The health and safety of our community is paramount, for without them, we would not be here.  As we reopen the Old Theater for business and performances, we highly encourage people to wear masks while indoors, regardless of their vaccination status, unless they are eating or drinking.  Thank you for your cooperation.
